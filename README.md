# snap-game
Snap is a popular card game in which players deal cards and react quickly to spot pairs of cards of the same rank.

Build a simple command line app that simulates two players play each other. For example, the app will output:

Bob turns card 'KS'
John turns card 'AH'
Bob turns card '2D'
John turns card '2C'
SNAP! John is the winner!!

The player with the quickest reactions to say SNAP, wins the game.
If there are no more cards left on the deck, the game is over and is a draw.
Also the app has to simuate random delay in turning each card so as to make the game look more realistic.
